MURaM is a numerical model that can be used to make detailed predictions about the Sun’s activity, and to understand the processes that drive solar variability. It's a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, which means that it takes into account the effects of the Sun’s magnetic field on the motion of its plasma. MURaM was designed to simulate the three outer layers of the Sun’s atmosphere - the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona. It’s used by scientists to study a wide range of solar phenomena, such as sunspots, solar flares, and the solar cycle.

The code was originally written in C/C++. Our team of scientists, engineers, and students focus on accelerating the simulation using OpenACC and GPUs. Our goal is to get closer to real-time simulation and prediction, while also increasing the detail and resolution of our results.
