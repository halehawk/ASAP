The Cloud Model version 1 is a mesoscale atmospheric model that
allows for idealized studies of atmospheric phenomena. A new
Lagrangian microphysics capability has been added which enables
a significantly more accurate representation than the traditional
bulk or multi-moment approaches frequently found in mesoscale
atmospheric models. We have utilized a directive-based approach
to enable a single source code to efficiently support the execution of
CM1 on both CPU and GPU-based computing platforms. In addition
to the use of accelerator directives, changes to the index search
scheme and the message-passing algorithms used by the lagrangian
microphysics were necessary to enable efficient execution. We focus
on a configuration of CM1 that will be used to investigate the impact
of oceanic sea spray on the atmospheric boundary layer within
a hurricane. We observe a factor of 2.9x reduction in time to the
solution when between eight NVIDIA A100 GPUs and eight AMD
Epyc based compute nodes
