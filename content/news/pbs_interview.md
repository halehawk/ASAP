In late November Thomas Hauser (CISL), Daniel Swain (MMM), Summer Wasson (CISL), and Sheri Voelz (CISL) participated in interviews at NWSC with a film crew from the PBS series "Weathered". They discussed how we use our Supercomputers to advance Earth system science. Specifically they discussed the science itself, how it's run on the computers, the hardware it's run on, and the efficiency of the facility.

The interviews will be featured in an episode on computer modeling climate that will be part of a multi-episode series on climate change. The series will likely stream August 2024.
