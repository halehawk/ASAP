NSF NCAR's High Altititue Obsersatory Laboratory (HAO) celebrated the collaborative MURaM project by awarding the team with the 2023 Walter O. Roberts Scientific and Technical Advancement Award for the Implementation of MURaM on Graphical Processing Units. 
The work enabled groundbreaking solar X-flare simulations on GPUs and CPUs, with a particular focus on enhancing radiation transport for high-resolution observation comparisons.

As you can see, the GPU optimized version of MURaM is scaling very closely to ideal values and it should be able to scale out to even larger problem sizes." width="300">}}

The awardees included: ASAP team members Cena Brown and Supreeth Madapur Suresh and external members Matthias Rempel, Eric Wright, Sunita Chandrasekaran, Damien Przyblyski, Shiquan Su, Rich Loft.
