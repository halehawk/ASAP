* Topics of interest include (but not limited to):
    * Tools and approaches for software testing, debugging, quality assurance, and continuous integration.
    * Statistical and ensemble-based approaches for evaluating model consistency and software correctness.
    * Software design approaches and development practices for streamlining correctness and reproducibility efforts.
    * Formal methods, abstraction, and logical proof techniques for rigorous verification.
    * Verifying and validating large-scale applications running on HPC clusters, cloud computing systems, heterogeneous systems, GPUs, etc.
    * Other software correctness and reproducibility approaches for facilitating verification and validation.


* Submissions may include technical results, approaches, experiences, and opinions involving one or more of the above topics applied to:
    * Climate and weather simulation codes such as drivers, couplers, frameworks, and model components.
    * External libraries and packages used in climate and weather simulation applications.
    * Artificial intelligence techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning, applied to climate and weather software.
    * Diagnostics, post-processing, visualization tools, and libraries.
    * Packaging, environment management, version control, and porting techniques for facilitating reproducibility.
    * Other software development and approaches extensively used within the climate and weather simulation context.
